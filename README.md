A powerful **delivery management API** built with Laravel 11, featuring **real-time tracking using Pusher**, authentication with Sanctum, role-based access with Spatie, and Coming soon API documentation with Swagger.

## API Design and Documentation

üõ°Ô∏è Security & Role-Based Access
Middleware & Controller-Based Role Checking

Role-based access is enforced at both middleware and controller levels.
Only authorized users can perform specific actions, ensuring a secure API.

üë§ User Role Restrictions
Role	Permissions
Admin	- Can assign deliveries to drivers
- Can delete deliveries
- Can view all deliveries
Driver	- Can update delivery status
- Can track their assigned deliveries
Customer	- Can only view their own deliveries
- Cannot modify delivery data
üîí API Security & Authentication
Laravel Sanctum is used for token-based authentication.
All API routes require authentication (auth:sanctum middleware).
JWT/Bearer Tokens are used to authenticate requests.
Role-based middleware (role:admin, role:driver, role:customer) restricts access to specific endpoints.
